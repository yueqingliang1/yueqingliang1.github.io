# Bio
Hi there! This is Yueqing Liang (梁月清), you can call me Luna as well. I am currently a first-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), advised by [Prof. Kai Shu](http://www.cs.iit.edu/~kshu/). Before joining IIT, I received my Master degree in Big Data in Business from University of Sydney in 2020, and my Bachelor degree in Telecommunications Engineering with Management from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications [(BUPT)](https://english.bupt.edu.cn) in 2018.

My research interests are in the broad areas of **machine learning** and **data mining**, including several related topics like **fairness**, **recommender system**, and **privacy**.
