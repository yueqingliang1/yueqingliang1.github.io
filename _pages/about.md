## Bio
Hi there! This is Yueqing Liang (梁月清), you can call me Luna as well. I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.iit.edu/computer-science) at [Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT)](https://www.iit.edu) since Spring 2022, advised by [Prof. Kai Shu](http://www.cs.iit.edu/~kshu/). Before joining IIT, I received my Master degree in [Big Data in Business](https://www.sydney.edu.au/handbooks/archive/2019/business_school_PG/coursework/subject_areas/big_data_business.shtml.html) from the [University of Sydney (USYD)](https://www.sydney.edu.au) in 2020, and my Bachelor degree in [Telecommunications Engineering with Management](http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/study-abroad/joint-programme-bupt/bupt-degree-programmes/#bteml) from [Queen Mary University of London (QMUL)](https://www.qmul.ac.uk) in 2018.

My research interests are in the broad areas of **machine learning** and **data mining**, including several related topics like **fairness**, **recommender system**, and **privacy**.
