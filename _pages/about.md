I am currently a Ph.D. student at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in University of California San Diego, advised by [Professor Xinyu Zhang](http://xyzhang.ucsd.edu). I received my B.E. in Internet of Things engineering in 2018 from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications [(BUPT)](https://english.bupt.edu.cn), where I also worked as a research intern with [Professor Anfu Zhou](https://scs.bupt.edu.cn/info/1100/2285.htm).

My research interests lie in mobile computing and wireless networking, with focus on 5G edge-assisted AI/ML and millimeter-wave networking.
